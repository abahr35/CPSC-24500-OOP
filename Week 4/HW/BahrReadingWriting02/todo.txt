EC:
2 pts – Find a way to handle duplicates. If I search John and 10 John’s exist how do you know which one I want? Note, just presenting 1, or a random John isn’t enough. This is a design/creativity challenge. How can you handle duplicate data?
2 pts – Delete student by name. I’ll enter a name and you’ll delete that student. NOTE, this is related to duplicate data. If there are 10 Johns, and I enter John to delete, I only want to delete one. 
Solve both of these and I’ll give you an additional 2 pts. There are a few ways, and I’ve seen some interesting choices. Both must handle duplicates correctly, only allowing me to delete 1 based on input I provide. How you define that behavior is up to you.
